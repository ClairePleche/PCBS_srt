# Is there a link between temporal and spatial distance in a sequence learning task?

Using a SRT (Serial Reaction Time) task, I want to modulate the spatial distance separating the four possible locations for the stimuli and the temporal distance (ISI). I would like to see if the motor performance is higher when the two distances correlate (close in space and in time).
