# Is there a link between temporal and spatial distance in a sequence learning/motor task?

Using a SRT (Serial Reaction Time) task, I want to modulate the spatial distance separating the four possible locations for the stimuli and the temporal distance (ISI). I would like to see if same condition (e.g. short ISI and spatially close stimuli) facilitates performance

## METHODS
![This a schema of the design](PCBS_srt/designtasktest.PNG)
### Task
- 4 aligned red squares one of them becomes another color(target) following a sequence (defined or random);
- The target is displayed until click from participant
- ISI = self paced, either 100 ms or 140 ms after they pressed the key;
- Stimuli either follow a 10-item sequence or are randomly displayed *(without two consecutive targets at the same location)*
- 17 Blocks including 2 training blocks at the beginning
- In the middle of sequence blocks, 3 random position blocks inserted to control for habituation effect
- 4 groups of participants for the 4 condition (short/short, short/long, long/short, long/long)

### Analysis

1. Reaction times
2. Accuracy
3. Expected results;
- for every condition of distance, RTs should decrease throughout blocks and longer RT when random block inserted/Accuracy should increase
- longer ISI easier than short
- but small spatial distance might reduce short ISI difficulty
