# Is there a link between temporal and spatial distance in a sequence learning/motor task?

Using a SRT (Serial Reaction Time) task, I want to modulate the spatial distance separating the four possible locations for the stimuli and the temporal distance (ISI). I would like to see if same condition facilitates performance

## METHODS

### Task
- 4 aligned red squares one of them becomes white following a sequence (defined or random);
- The white square is displayed during ... ms
- ISI = self paced, either 100 ms or 140 ms after they pressed the key;
- Stimuli either follow a 12 item sequence or are randomly displayed *(without two consecutive targets at the same location)*
- ... Blocks including ... training blocks at the begining
- after training blocks do .. block(s) with random order

### Analysis

1. Reaction times

2. Accuracy

3. Expected results;
- for every condition of distance, RTs should decrease throughout blocks and longer RT when random block inserted/Accuracy should increase
- longer ISI easier than short
- but small spatial distance might reduce short ISI difficulty
